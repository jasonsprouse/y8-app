## Introduction

We're thrilled to announce a powerful new feature on our platform: the **Non-Person Entity (NPE) Manager**. Located in the "Digital" tab of our new `/shop`, this tool allows you to create, manage, and interact with NPEs, which are essentially Lit Protocol Public Key Pairs (PKPs) that can act as autonomous agents.

This guide will walk you through the NPE manager, explain its core concepts, and unveil a new business model that will allow you to leverage this technology for your own projects.

## What are NPEs?

A Non-Person Entity (NPE) is a digital identity that is not tied to a specific person. Think of it as a bot, a DAO, or an IoT device that can own its own data and execute actions on its own behalf. In our system, each NPE is represented by a Lit Protocol PKP, which gives it a unique cryptographic identity and the ability to sign transactions and messages.

With our new NPE manager, you can now easily create and manage these digital agents, opening up a world of possibilities for automation, decentralized applications, and more.

## How to Use the NPE Manager

You can find the NPE Manager in the "Digital" tab of the `/shop`. Here's how to get started:

### 1. Generate a New NPE

To create a new NPE, simply click the **"Generate NPE"** button. This will mint a new PKP and display its details, including its Ethereum address and public key.

### 2. View Your Existing NPEs

If you have existing PKPs associated with your account, you can view them by clicking the **"Refresh PKPs"** button. This will fetch all of your PKPs and display them in a list.

### 3. Manage NPE Schemas

Each NPE has an extensible JSON schema that you can use to store metadata and configuration. This is where you can define the properties and capabilities of your NPE.

To edit an NPE's schema, simply modify the values in the input fields. You can also add new fields by entering a name in the "New field name" input and clicking **"Add Field"**.

**Note:** Currently, schema data is stored in the client-side state and will not persist. We are working on a backend solution to store this data securely and permanently.

## A New Business Model: Freemium, Base, and Premium NPEs

We believe that NPEs have the potential to revolutionize the way we build and interact with applications. To encourage adoption and innovation, we're introducing a new business model built around the NPE manager:

### Freemium Tier

*   **Features:**
    *   Create up to 3 NPEs.
    *   Basic schema management (up to 5 fields).
    *   Limited access to Lit Actions.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Experimenting with NPEs and exploring their capabilities.
    *   Building simple bots and automations.
    *   Personal projects and prototypes.

### Base Tier

*   **Cost:** \$10/month
*   **Features:**
    *   Create up to 25 NPEs.
    *   Advanced schema management (up to 25 fields).
