# Validation Tests for Login Logic and Route Guard

This document provides step-by-step validation tests to verify the authentication and route guard functionality is working correctly.

## Changes Made

### 1. RouteGuard Component
- **Before**: Used an array of explicit auth paths that didn't handle query parameters
- **After**: Implemented `isPublicOrAuthPath()` helper that uses `pathname.startsWith('/auth')` to handle all auth routes including callbacks with query parameters

### 2. AuthContext Component
- **Before**: No automatic redirect after successful login
- **After**: 
  - Added `shouldRedirect` parameter to `updateSession()` 
  - All login methods now redirect to `/space` after successful authentication when on the main page (`/`)
  - OAuth callbacks don't trigger automatic redirect (they handle their own redirect to `/space`)
  - PKP selection also triggers redirect appropriately

## Manual Validation Tests

### Test 1: Unauthenticated User Cannot Access Protected Routes
**Purpose**: Verify route guard blocks access to protected pages

**Steps**:
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/space`
4. **Expected**: User is redirected to `/` (landing/login page)
5. Try accessing `http://localhost:3000/space/sunshade`
6. **Expected**: User is redirected to `/` (landing/login page)

**Status**: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

### Test 2: Public and Auth Paths Are Accessible
**Purpose**: Verify public and auth callback paths work without authentication

**Steps**:
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`
3. **Expected**: Login page displays without redirect
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/auth`
5. **Expected**: Auth page displays without redirect
6. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback/google` (with query params if possible)
7. **Expected**: Page loads (may show error but doesn't redirect to `/`)

**Status**: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

4. Click "Connect Wallet" or similar option
5. Connect wallet and sign message
6. **Expected**: 
   - User is authenticated
   - User is automatically redirected to `/space`
   - localStorage contains auth data

**Status**: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

### Test 7: Session Persistence After Page Refresh
**Purpose**: Verify authentication state persists across page reloads

**Steps**:
1. Complete any login method successfully
2. Verify you're on `/space` or another protected route
3. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. **Expected**: 
   - Page loads without redirect to login
   - User remains authenticated
   - No login prompt appears
5. Check localStorage still has: `lit-auth-method`, `lit-pkp`, `lit-session-sigs`

**Status**: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

---

### Test 8: Logout Functionality
**Purpose**: Verify logout clears session and redirects appropriately

**Steps**:
1. Log in with any method
2. Navigate to a protected route
3. Click logout button (typically in Dashboard component)
4. **Expected**: 
   - localStorage is cleared
   - User is redirected to `/`
   - Check: `localStorage.getItem('lit-pkp')` should be null
5. Try accessing `/space`

### Test 9: Multiple PKP Selection
**Purpose**: Verify PKP selection works when user has multiple PKPs

2. Navigate directly to `/space/sunshade`
3. **Expected**: Redirected to `/` (login page)
4. Complete login
5. **Expected**: Redirected to `/space` (default protected page)
6. **Note**: Deep link return is not yet implemented, but user should at least reach a protected page

**Status**: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

---

## Automated Verification (Console)

Run these commands in browser console to check auth state:

```javascript
// Check if authenticated
console.log('Auth Method:', localStorage.getItem('lit-auth-method'));
console.log('PKP:', localStorage.getItem('lit-pkp'));
console.log('Session Sigs:', localStorage.getItem('lit-session-sigs'));

// Clear auth (for testing)
localStorage.removeItem('lit-auth-method');
localStorage.removeItem('lit-pkp');
localStorage.removeItem('lit-session-sigs');

// Or clear all
localStorage.clear();
```

## Expected Behavior Summary

### Protected Routes
All routes EXCEPT the following require authentication:
- `/` - Landing/login page
- `/auth` - Auth selection page  
- `/auth/callback/*` - OAuth callback handlers

### After Successful Login
- User data stored in localStorage
- User redirected to `/space` (when logging in from `/` main page)
- OAuth callbacks handle their own redirect to `/space`
- User can access all protected routes

### Route Guard Behavior
- Shows loading spinner while checking auth state
- Redirects unauthenticated users to `/`
- Allows public/auth paths without authentication
- Renders protected content for authenticated users

## Known Limitations

1. **No "Return To" URL**: After login, user always goes to `/space`, not necessarily where they originally tried to go
2. **Session Expiry**: No automatic session refresh or expiry handling visible to user
3. **No Logout Button Everywhere**: Logout may only be available on certain pages
4. **Browser localStorage Dependency**: Using private/incognito mode or clearing localStorage logs user out

## Reporting Issues

If any test fails, document:
1. Test number and name
2. Steps taken
3. Expected behavior
4. Actual behavior
5. Browser console errors
6. Network tab information (for OAuth flows)
7. localStorage state
