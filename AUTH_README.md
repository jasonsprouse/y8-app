# Authentication & Route Guard - Quick Reference

## ✅ What Was Fixed

This PR fixes the login logic and route guard to ensure proper authentication flow.

### Key Changes
1. **Dynamic Route Protection** - OAuth callback URLs now work with query parameters
2. **Automatic Redirects** - Users redirected to `/space` after successful login
3. **No More Redirect Loops** - Smart detection prevents competing redirects

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Validation
```bash
node validate-auth.js
```
Expected: 22/22 tests passing ✅

### Test Manually
1. Clear browser localStorage
2. Try to access `/space` → should redirect to `/`
3. Log in with any method → should redirect to `/space`
4. Refresh page → should stay logged in
5. Logout → should redirect to `/`

- **[TESTING_GUIDE.md](./TESTING_GUIDE.md)** - Manual testing procedures and implementation details
- **[VALIDATION_TESTS.md](./VALIDATION_TESTS.md)** - 12 comprehensive test scenarios

## 🔐 Authentication Methods Supported

- ✅ Google OAuth
- ✅ Discord OAuth  
- ✅ WebAuthn (Passkeys)
- ✅ Ethereum Wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
- ✅ Stytch OTP (Email/Phone)

## 🛡️ Route Protection

### Public Routes (No Auth Required)
- `/` - Landing/login page
- `/auth/*` - All auth pages and callbacks

### Protected Routes (Auth Required)
- `/space` - All space services
- `/food` - Food services
- `/energy` - Energy services
- `/health` - Health services
- All other routes

## 🔄 Login Flow

```
User → Login → Auth Success → Redirect to /space → Access Protected Routes
```

## 📝 localStorage Keys

The app stores auth state in localStorage:
- `lit-auth-method` - Authentication method used
- `lit-pkp` - PKP (Programmable Key Pair) data
- `lit-session-sigs` - Session signatures for Lit Protocol

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Can't access protected routes after login
- Check: `localStorage.getItem('lit-pkp')` should have data
- Try: Clear localStorage and login again

**Issue**: Infinite redirects
- Check: Make sure you're using latest code (this should be fixed)
- Try: Clear browser cache and localStorage

**Issue**: OAuth callback fails
- Check: Console for error messages
- Verify: OAuth credentials are configured correctly

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Automatic redirect after login
- ✅ Session persistence across page refreshes
- ✅ Proper logout with session cleanup
- ✅ Multiple PKP selection support
- ✅ Error handling and display
- ✅ Loading states for better UX

1. Review the comprehensive docs listed above
2. Run `node validate-auth.js` to check implementation
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Verify localStorage contains auth data after login
