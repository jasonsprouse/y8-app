- [ ] localStorage keys match: `lit-auth-method`, `lit-pkp`, `lit-session-sigs`

**Issues Found:**
```
(List any issues here)
```

---

### Route Protection

- [ ] No hardcoded auth callback paths
- [ ] `RouteGuard` component used correctly

**Issues Found:**
```
(List any issues here)
```

---

### Redirect Logic

- [ ] Redirects to `/space` after successful login
- [ ] OAuth callbacks don't create double-redirects
- [ ] Uses `shouldRedirect` parameter correctly in `updateSession()`
- [ ] Logout redirects to `/`
- [ ] No open redirect vulnerabilities

**Issues Found:**
```
(List any issues here)
```

---

### Authentication Methods
